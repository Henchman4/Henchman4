- 👋 Hi, I’m Ramon
- 👀 I’m interested in Outdoors, Animals, Web Development, Kenshi, and building something with hands or with my trusty laptop.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from The Odin Project.
- 💞️ About me: I was interested in Web Development 5 years ago but I got stuck in what I learned is called "Tutorial Hell". I was staring at the wall in my home when I had an epiphany. Why am I not learning to code, so I researched for an hour ( I set a time because I didn't want to repeat the same mistake ) and I stumbled upon The Odin Project. I understand there are other learning sites but I really liked The Odin Project because they showed me how to set up an environment for Web Development. I've been excited since. I am happy to be in a community that enjoys creating.
